# This script it used to code a robot to track a line, identify its proximity to a crate and trap it when close enough, and deliver it to a target zone.
# This is donee by using EV3 light sensors to track the line while using an ultrasound sensor to identify proximity to crate, and servo motors to drive robot and robot arms.
# The robot tracked the line, found the crate, and delivered it without issue.
